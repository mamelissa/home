	 <h1> Assassination Classroom Nagisa Shiota</h1>
	    <p> Nagisa Shiota is a student in Korosensei's Class 3-E of Kunugigaoka Junior High School and the protagonist and main narrator of Assassination Classroom. 
		He is also the one who ultimately assassinated Korosensei. Seven years later, he becomes the adviser of Paradise High School Class 3-5.
        Nagisa is a petite framed boy with light blue hair and azure eyes. His hair goes past his shoulders due to his mother forcing him to keep it that way. 
		He kept it in a pony tail until Kaede Kayano joined the classroom and put it in two pigtails. He is known for his androgynous appearance which has often been poked
		fun at by many people - most notably, Rio Nakamura and Karma Akabane.

		   Has blue hair in ponytails, wears school uniform and holding a gun and a knife"/>
		
		Seven years after graduation, his hair is noticeably shorter and no longer tied in pigtails, though he still keeps his bangs.
        Nagisa is a calm, collected, and friendly individual. He is exceptionally observant and circumspect of his surroundings and the situations that develop around him.
		He tends to pay strict attention to Korosensei in hopes to understand the motives of this mysterious being and compiles the information he has gathered in his note
		reference. Despite his calm demeanor, he harbors deep insecurity about his talents and how he is perceived by the people around him. 
		This is reflected by lack of goals and general pessimism about his own future. Nagisa also isn't easily fazed by things that would unnerve the average person 
		as shown with his interactions with Karma and the prospect of using a real knife.
